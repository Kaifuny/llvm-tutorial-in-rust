# LLVM Turorial (Based on Rust Language)

[Chinese](README.md) [English](README.en.md)

## Motivation

* Recently learning Rust language, and may need to study LLVM IR related knowledge due to work reasons.
* [Official LLVM Tutorial Document](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html), there are few Chinese translations
* MLIR is a sub-project of LLVM, is the infrastructure of the artificial intelligence field, and also needs to understand the basic knowledge of LLVM IR

## Reasonable Expectations

* As the cognitive level increases, the understanding of LLVM IR will gradually deepen, and it is **difficult** to guarantee the completeness and correctness of this document.
* This document is still written based on the [official LLVM Tutorial document](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html), and will be written according to the outline of this tutorial, **supplemented and modified based on my own understanding and practical experience**.
* MLIR is not the focus of this document, and may be briefly introduced in some chapters.
* Although performance issues are an important indicator, the main focus here is on principle reproduction

## Development Environment

`TODO`
